## Description
physics adds some simple physics to all simple humanmade blocks from the default mod.
the physics system works a bit like how this guy explains it: https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?id=3032 except that this is even simpler
It works with one abm and special groups for all affected blocks

## Notes
physics can be played with Minetest 0.4.14 or above.
It depends on the default mod only

## List of features
all simple humanmade blocks have physics now, these include cobble, bricks, wood, and all full material blocks

## FAQ
Why are not all blocks supported?
most blocks use there param2 variable, so this variable is not available for this mod. This mod needs param2 to calulate what blocks are stable
