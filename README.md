## Description
physics adds some simple physics to all simple humanmade blocks from the default mod.
the physics system works a bit like how this guy explains it: https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?id=3032 except that this is even simpler
It works with one abm and special groups for all affected blocks

-- A short introduction to your mod. It should explain what is the main idea of your mod and what it does.

## Notes
physics can be played with Minetest 0.4.14 or above.
It depends on the default mod only

## List of features

-- all simple humanmade blocks have physics now
these include cobble, bricks, wood, and all full material blocks

## FAQ
Why are not all blocks supported?
most blocks use there param2 variable so this variable is not available for this mod and this mod needs that variable to calulate what blocks are stable
